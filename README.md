# Beauty Blog

This is a personal beauty blog built entirely from scratch. The frontend is React and the backend utilizes Supabase for data storage and retrieval.

The project showcases my skills in frontend development, database management, API integration as well as in creating responsive wwebsites.

Feel free to explore and of course to give me your feedback! The latter is much appreciated.
